# Description

This project is a React Contact List which uses React JavaScript Framework.
This project is a fake contactlist with search bar, that GETs the contacts from API and sort them alphabetically. Search bar filters these contacts by first name, last name and email on live. This list has also ability to set desired contacts checked, store the ID's of checked contact in console, and "remember" checked contacts during filtering.

# Technology stack
* ReactJS
* REST API
* React Spinners ([npm here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners))

# Notes

On some devices contact list might be not FETCHed because of CORS policy. This problem is caused by used API, not by the App itself.
